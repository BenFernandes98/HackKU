# HackKU
Code submission for the 2020 Hackathon hosted by Kansas University. Participants include Ryan, Ben, Grant, and Kris.

Requirements:
the main.go server needs to be running in order for the project to function properly (we did this on localhost via command line - cd into the folder and then run go main.go)
if you got issues idk cause I barely knew what the heck I was doing

For the python script, you will need to import the graphics, tkinter, and Pillow libraries.

Main file is Cornhub_Final.py, but almost everything in the final folder is necessary.
